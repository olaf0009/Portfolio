# final-Portfolio

This is a final of my portfolio project coded from scratching using HTML and CSS. 
The website uses the container structure to achive perfect alignment of content
The site responds at 3 different breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Challenges Faced

1. The first challenge I had was to acheieve the XD mock-up as closely as possible using minimal lines of code
2. Also getting the website to respond with different images sizes at different breakpoints was a tussle
3. Coding the contact form and styling accordingly in CSS was a bit of a challenge

## Overcoming Challenges

1. The XD mock-up served as a map to help help achieve a level of pixel perfection in many parts of the code.
    I was able to measure box sizes and padding in XD and translate the information to my code. 
    Also, using pseudo classes help reduce my lines of code.
2.  For the website to be optimized and respond seamlessly, I painstakinglingly resized my images in Photoshop 
    in multiple resolutions and using the <picture> <source> and <srcset> attributes, I was able to call different 
    images at different breakpoints set in my media queries.
3.  I was able to make reference to w3c schools to see how to properly code and style form elements.

## What I Learned

    Overall, it was a mind streching experiences as i got to put my knowledge of HTML and CSS to test.
    Also i learnt the importance of using puseduo classes and how the container structure helps keep things tidy.
